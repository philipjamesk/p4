## Description
This website is for taking online quizzes. It allows for users who are teachers to create and edit quizzes while non-teachers can only take quizzes and view their grades.

## Details for teaching team
When the database is seeded there are four users that are created by default. 
* jill@harvard.edu - Teacher
* john@harvard.edu
* jennifer@havard.edu
* jamal@harvard.edu

All of them have the same password (helloworld), and the three non-teacher's all have taken different number of quizzes when seeded.

There are four quizzes (with corresponding questions and answers) also built while seeded
* Alphabet Quiz - active; has grades
* Numbers Quiz - active; has grades
* Other Quiz - inactive; no grades; ready to set to active
* Not Ready Quiz - inactive; no grades; not ready to be set to active
